[AuctioneerAdvanced]
#desc	A small pack with just the basics of {{AuctioneerAdvanced}}. Perfect for adding on to the {{AuctioneerClassic Suite}} when you're thinking of moving to {{AuctioneerAdvanced}} and want to start collecting scan data. {{AuctioneerAdvanced}} is an addon which makes your time spent at the auction house more productive by remembering prices, finding bargains and suggesting prices based upon past data. It's not meant to be an all-in-one perfect solution, however in the hands of an expert, it will help make lots of money.

[Enchantrix]
#desc	For the enchanter who just wants the basic disenchant and barking functionality, contains just {{Enchantrix}} and {{Enchantrix-Barker}}. {{Enchantrix}} is an addon which predicts disenchant results based off accumulated disenchant data. It does come with it's own database, so right out of the box, it's pretty good at estimating the actual probability of disenchant results. {{Enchantrix-Barker}} is a product which will let you broadcast your disenchants on the trade channel with ease. {{Enchantrix}} can combine with {{BottomScanner}} to provide additional buying for disenchant opportunities.

[BottomScanner]
#desc	This {{BottomScanner}} standalone package is useful if you want to use {{BottomScanner}} with something other than {{AuctioneerClassic}} or {{AuctioneerAdvanced}} for it's pricing data, if you want to add it to {{Enchantrix}} or just use it stand-alone. {{BottomScanner}} allows searching and analysis of the auction contents for specific good buys. When it identifies something that is a "good buy" according to the rules you set, it will alert you and give you the choice to buy or bid on the item.
