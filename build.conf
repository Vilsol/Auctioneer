[Enchantrix]
#desc	This basic package is for the Enchanter who only requires Disenchanting and trade channel "enchant advertising" functionality; it contains {{Enchantrix}} and {{Enchantrix-Barker}}. {{Enchantrix}} predicts disenchant results based off of accumulated disenchant data and includes a fully customizable, preset price database of its own.  Right out of the box, {{Enchantrix}} is able to provide decent pricing estimates, but should be updated with the pricing of your given realm/faction.

[Informant]
#desc	This package provides basic item data in each item's tooltip.  Through {{Informant}}, the user is able to customize the data shown when mousing-over an item.  The database includes such critical information as the use(s) of the item (Quests, crafting, et cetera), which, if any, NPC vendors sell the item, and the prices NPC vendors use when buying or selling the item.  The included database is renewed periodically, so {{Informant}} is ready to go once installed.

[BottomScanner]
#desc	This standalone package is useful for those who desire {{BottomScanner}} functionality with pricing data from something other than {{AuctioneerAdvanced}} or if you want to add it to {{Enchantrix}}. {{BottomScanner}} allows searching and analysis of the Auction House contents for specific good buys. Once configured and running, you will be alerted with a choice to Bid, Buy, or Ignore an auction that meets or exceeds your chosen criteria.
