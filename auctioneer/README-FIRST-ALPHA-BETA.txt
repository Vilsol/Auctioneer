There is no support to import your old auctioneer data in alpha or beta releases. Back up your old data first. This is because we cannot guarantee that the DB format in any alpha or beta will be permanently set in stone.

If you don't understand this, you probably shouldn't be using alpha or beta mods.

There are known current issues, but this doesn't mean we're hard at work fixing them right at this moment. We could well be working hard on the backend rather than concentrating on UI fluff ;)

Known current issues for 3.9.xxxx:

(Moonmoon, 10 Dec 2006)
. Search Auctions tab->Search->Competion throws an error message regarding 'logicalColumn'.

(Normal, 10 Dec 2006)
. New addon, btmscan (not yet included in our alpha releases), not playing 100% nicely.

If you're going to report a bug to us on our alpha/beta builds, please ensure you're using the latest development version from http://auctioneeraddon.com/dl
