				<function="Auctioneer_GetHighestSellablePriceForOne" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				The parametervalidation was bugged. Instead of only checking for nil values, it also checked if useCachedPrices was true, so the function always returned nil, if it shouldn't work with CachedPrices.
				Also changed the code to only call auctionKey() once.

				<function="Auctioneer_GetHighestSellablePriceForOne" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				As this function is also used by Enchantrix, I made it global again and changed the name to match the other global ones.
				Also added some checks to make sure that the given parameters are valid.

			<file name="auctioneer.lua">
				<function="Auctioneer_NewTooltip" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				Removed the data reference from the function, as that global no longer exists and the value was only used to calculate the sell/buy prices for items with an itemID <= 0.
				For those items there is currently no sell/buy value calculated (as I have no idea, what an itemId <= 0 could mean)
				Also removed the now useless local money variable and replaced the initialization of sell/buy.
			</developer>
			<public>
				fixed the "attempt to index global `data' (a string value)" bug

				<function="Auctioneer_ProcessLink" />
			</file>
			<developer>
				Major typo fixed in that function. Instead of xxxxx_ProcessLinks, xxxxx_ProcessLink was tried to call which never existed and therefore the integration into IM/LL never worked.
				Also changed the parameters to match the latest versions of both addons.
			</developer>
			<public>
				Fixed incompatibilitybug with latest versions of ItemsMatrix and Lootlink

				Missed to change the functions called in getHighestSellablePriceForOne and getMarketPrice to use alternate realms/factions.
				Where needed, I've added a new optional parameter to the functions which allows to work with data from other realms/factions.

				BID_BASED_CATEGORIES used the english category-names as it's keyvalue and compared it to the strings returned by GetAuctionItemClasses. That only worked fine for the English client. For others (like the German/French client) the comparisons always returned false, even if they should be true, as the GetAuctionItemClasses returns the localized strings (Armor = R&uuml;stung, Weapon = Waffen, etc.).
				A converter has also been added which is called once when the VARIABLES LOADED event is raised to convert old categorydata to the new format. This converter can easily be adjusted to new datachanges and takes very little time if the data has already been converted.
				All corresponding calls have been changed. The stringvalue still used for auctionDoneKey in GetAuctionItemClasses.
				The prototype of Auctioneer_AuctionEntry_Hook has also be changed. The last value should now be the integer representative of the category (was the string value).
				Also did some tiny code optimizations in some of the abovementioned functions.
			</developer>
			<public>
				If you used another clientversion than the english one, auctioneer didn't always use bidbased prices, when it should have.
				As a sideeffect, that bugfix also reduced the memoryusage a bit.

				removed the code which calculates the marketprice from getHighestSellablePriceForOne and added it to a seperate function: getMarketPrice
				added the realm-parameter to getHighestSellablePriceForOne, which is used by getMarketPrice and needed for Auctioneer_NewTooltip (suggested price for alternative realms)
				replaced the calculations of the suggested prices in Auctioneer_NewTooltip by the calculation done in Auctioneer_OnEvent
				Changed the tooltipoutput for suggested prices and removed the bid-value (it doesn't make any sense here)
			</developer>
			<public>
				The suggested price shown in the tooltip differed from the one which was displayed when putting a new item in the AH.
				Also removed the (xxx bidded) text in the suggested price-line, as it had no purpose at all.

				The overaul minimum startbid is now correctly named start bid. Before it was called &quot;minimum&quot; which could be easily misunderstood.
