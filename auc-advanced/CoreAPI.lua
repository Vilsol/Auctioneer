	This is an addon for World of Warcraft that adds statistical history to the auction data that is collected
	when the auction is scanned, so that you can easily determine what price
	you will be able to sell an item for at auction or at a vendor whenever you
	mouse-over an item in the game

	This function acquires the current market value of the mentioned item using
	a configurable algorithm to process the data used by the other installed
	algorithms.
	The result of this function does not take into account competition, it
	simply returns what a particular item is "Worth", and not what you could
	currently sell it for.
