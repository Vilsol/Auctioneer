[b][size=5][center]Auctioneer AddOns Change log for 3.2 – 3.4[/center][/size][/b]
[b][size=3]Auctioneer:[/size][/b]
[list]
[*]Changes in the interface:
[list]
[*]Moved the Auto-Auction functionality from Alt+Click to Alt+Shift+Click. Alt+Click will now only more the item to the sell slot. (Ftkxde)
[*]Remove item suffixes from search string, which is entered as Browse Text when using alt-click/alt-right click feature. (Ftkxde)
[*]Auctioneer now uses an Object Oriented approach to function calls. All functions have been moved into the Auctioneer table. Any AddOns that require Auctioneer will need to be re-written to accommodate this change. (MentalPower)
[*]The “/auctioneer help” command will print the current Auctioneer version number. (MentalPower)
[/list]
[*]New Features:
[list]
[*]New command, “/auctioneer finish (off | logout | exit | reloadui)” which will do the selected action once a scan has completed. NOTE: This action will be done always until deactivated. (MentalPower)
[*]The pricing model (“Undercutting by 5%”, “Competition above market”) will now be shown on the tooltip when the “/auctioneer show-suggest” is enabled. (MentalPower)
[*]The pricing model in the tooltip and in the Auction House frame will be color-coded based on whether or not it’s favorable to post an item at this time or not. This is enabled by default. To disable this functionality you can use the “/auctioneer warn-color” command. (MentalPower)
[*]The pricing model will also be shown when creating a new auction with the Auto-Auction feature. Color-coding will be used if it’s enabled. (Ftkxde)
[*]New “Search Auctions” tab has been added to the Auction House frame. This tab is meant to be the graphical equivalent of the “/auctioneer percentless”, “/auctioneer broker”, “/auctioneer bidbroker” and “/auctioneer compete” commands. (Vindicator)
[*]New “Post Auctions” tab has been added to the Auction House frame. This tab is meant to allow multiple postings of the same item to be done with a single click. (Vindicator)
[*]The “/auctioneer also” command has been improved to support the “home” and “neutral” special keywords. These keywords will mean that the also section will fill with home-faction data always, not dependant on the current server. The “neutral” command works in a similar way. (MentalPower)
[*]The “/auctioneer also” section of the tooltip will no longer show duplicate data if the source (Realm-Faction) is the same as the main data (i.e. both reference Auctioneer-Alliance). (MentalPower)
[*]Auctioneer will now use IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) based median to calculate prices. This will result in a better handling of outliers (5000g auctions on Wool Cloth for example). (Karavirs)
[*]The AskPrice mod is now integrated into Auctioneer; this will allow you to give out pricing info on items via queries made to guild chat, party chat or whispers. Queries are in the form of “?x[Item Link 1]y[Item Link 2]” where “?” is the trigger character and “x” and “y” are the stack sizes. This functionality is default off. To enable AskPrice and configure its settings you can use “/auctioneer askprice” to see the help section for it. Khaos support is also built-in. (AskPrice by Mikezter, integration by MentalPower)
[/list]
[*]Bug Fixes:
[list]
[*]Fixed a nil error when using the “/auctioneer clear all” command. Also fixed the clear function so that it only clears data from the current Server-Faction. (MentalPower)
[*]Fixed an error when changing the percentage based options, and their effect not being updated until a ReloadUI. (MentalPower)
[*]Improved overall calculation efficiency and reliability. (Aradan)
[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]Informant:[/size][/b]
[list]
[*]Changes in the interface:
[list]
[*]If an item is used in more than two professions, Informant will now wrap the information in order to keep the tooltip a reasonable size. (MentalPower)
[/list]
[*]New Features:
[list]
[*]Informant will now show if the item is used in a quest and how many of that item are required for the quest. (Norganna)
[*]Informant will now show the inventory icon for an item (whenever it is returned by the game) in the upper-right corner of the tooltip. This feature is only available when the enhanced tooltip (not embedded) is used. This functionality can be turned off with the use of the “/informant show-icon” command. (MentalPower)
[/list]
[*]Bug Fixes:
[list]
[*]Informant will now correctly disable itself when the “/informant off” command is used. The toggle command now works properly too. (Ftkxde)
[*]Restored the key binding labels. Somehow these were lost during the reorganization of the localization method. (Ftkxde)
[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]Enchantrix:[/size][/b]
[list]
[*]Changes in the interface:
[list]
[*]Enchantrix' tooltip will now display confidence interval for disenchant probabilities. Also, reagents are now colored according to rarity and sorted in order of probability. Added basic framework for tooltip customization. (Aradan)
[/list]
[*]New Features:
[list]
[*]After much testing and disenchanting we have found that all items of the same class (armor or weapons), same quality (Uncommon [green] or Rare [blue]) and within the same five levels range (51-55) disenchant into the same reagents. This logic has now been incorporated into Enchantrix. (Aradan)
[*]Enchantrix will now get disenchant results via the “LOOT_OPENED” event instead of scanning for bag updates. This results in a more reliable prediction and provides a nice link. (Aradan)
[*]Added tooltip with suggested price for enchants. Just click on an enchanting link to see it. (Aradan)
[/list]
[*]Bug Fixes:
[list]
[*]Added “Nexus Crystal” to the list of possible disenchants results. (Ftkxde)
[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]EnhTooltip:[/size][/b]
[list]
[*]Changes in the interface:
[list]
[*]Changed the maximum number of lines in the “Enhanced Tooltip” to 40 and the maximum number of money objects to 30. (MentalPower)
[/list]
[*]New Features:
[list]
[*]Added API-function EnhTooltip.LinkType(link) to determine type of link (enchant, item or whatever Blizzard may think of next). (Aradan)
[*]EnhTooltip.GetTextGSC() will now take a third parameter that if true will cause the function to return a string without color codes. (MentalPower)
[*]Added hook for SetCraftSpell(). (Aradan)
[/list]
[*]Bug Fixes:
[list]
[*]The EnhTooltip tooltip will no longer overlap with the standard game tooltip. (Legorol, Nephyrin and Gravix)
[*]When using the embedded feature, duplicate data will no longer be shown. (Legorol)
[*]EnhTooltip will now behave properly when an inventory icon is passed to it. (MentalPower)
[*]Now using the 1.9.1 Blizzard API-function GetItemQualityColor() instead of static color values. (Aradan)
[*]EnhTooltip.FakeLink() will consult GetItemInfo() if quality or name is missing from argument list. (Aradan)
[*]Fixed a bug in EnhTooltip.GetTextGSC() that caused money text to display copper even if the copper part was zero. (Aradan)
[*]Tooltips should now stay completely on-screen even if they’re extremely big. (Vindicator)
[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]Stubby:[/size][/b]
[list]
[*]Bug Fixes:

[/list]

[b][size=3]Installer:[/size][/b]

[list]

[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]All AddOns:[/size][/b]
[list]
[*]Changes in the interface:
[list]
[*]The “nopatch” files have been removed from the zip packages, as the new Cosmos Patcher does not use them. You should now use the “Protect All Non Cosmos” option inside the “Manage AddOns” button in order to prevent the Auctioneer AddOns from getting automatically deleted. (MentalPower)
[*]Numerous other bug fixes and enhancements that you probably won’t even notice.
[/list]
