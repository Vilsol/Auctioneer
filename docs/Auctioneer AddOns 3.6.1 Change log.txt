[b][size=5][center]Auctioneer AddOns Change log for 3.6 – 3.6.1[/center][/size][/b]

[b][size=3]BeanCounter:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Bug Fixes:
	[list]
		[*]BeanCounter will now correctly state its loaded state when “/beancounter” is used. (MentalPower)
		[*]BeanCounter is now fully compatible with the MailCollector AddOn. (Vindicator)
		[*]BeanCounter will now request the correct localization of strings. This fixes a bug where if the locale setting was set to something other than GetLocale(),  BeanCounter would not recognize mail messages from the Auction Houses. (MentalPower)
