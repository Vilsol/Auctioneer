[b][size=5][center]Auctioneer AddOns Change log for 3.4 – 3.6[/center][/size][/b]

[b][size=3]Auctioneer:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Changes in the interface:
	[list]
		[*]Merged GetItemSnapshotMedianBuyout() and GetSnapMedian() into GetItemSnapshotMedianBuyout(). (Aradan)
		[*]Merged GetItemHistoryMedianBuyout() and GetHistMedian() into GetItemHistoryMedianBuyout(). (Aradan)
		[*]SetHistMed() and SetSnapMed() now take “nil” as an argument to clear the cache, this forces GetItem<Foo>MedianBuyout() to recalculate median. (Aradan)
		[*]The Post Auctions tab will now make use of the “/auctioneer auction-duration” command. (Aradan)
		[*]The double suggest line in the tooltip’s “/auctioneer also” field has been eliminated. (MentalPower)
		[*]The order of the “/auctioneer also” fields in the tooltip have been altered to be more consistent with the order of information at the top of the tooltip. (MentalPower)
		[*]The Post Auctions tab will now use a combination of the ItemID, Enchant and RandomProp fields to identify items. This fixes issues with items that have the same name. (Vindicator)
		[*]The auction auto-create feature will now print the item link of the item that was auctioned to the chat frame. (MentalPower)
		[*]The unused AuctionConfig.success table has been removed. This results in a savings in the size of our saved variables file by about 10%. Auctioneer will ask you to upgrade your DB in order to make this change. (Luke1410)
	[/list]
	[*]New Features:
	[list]
		[*]Added convenience function Auctioneer.Util.PriceForOne(price, count). It accepts nil arguments and rounds up to nearest integer. (Aradan)
		[*]The report printed to the chat frame after a scan has finished will now also be printed to the actual AH window. (MentalPower)
		[*]Auctioneer.Command.OnOff() can now accept a Boolean parameter. (MentalPower)
	[/list]
	[*]Bug Fixes:
	[list]
		[*]“/auctioneer clear snapshot” will now correctly clear the HSP cache table. (Aradan)
		[*]Scanning will now correctly clear out the defunct buyout lists. (Aradan)
		[*]GetUsableMedian() could return history median even when history median was not shown in the tooltip (snapCount > histCount). (Aradan)
		[*]BuildLowestCache() will no longer return a random item as second lowest. (Aradan)
		[*]Update or clear snap/history median cache in several locations. (Aradan)
		[*]Buying out an auction will remove that price from snapshot buyout values, if found. (Aradan)
		[*]The “/auctioneer askprice ad” command has been fixed and can now be correctly enabled or disabled. (MentalPower)
	[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]BeanCounter:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]BeanCounter is a new AddOn that tracks Auction House purchases and sales. It does so by logging any bids made to any items, or any auctions that you post and correlating that information with the resulting mails from the Auction House. For characters in which you want BeanCounter to track Auction House activity, you must have the AddOn loaded whenever you bid or post auctions and read mail. By default it loads when visiting the Auction House or the Mailbox. Auction House activity (purchases and sales) can be queried via the new Transactions tab in the Auction House interface.(Vindicator)
[/list]

[b][size=3]Enchantrix:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Changes in the interface:
	[list]
		[*]Enchantrix now uses an Object Oriented approach to function calls. All functions have been moved into the Enchantrix table. Any AddOns that require Enchantrix will need to be re-written to accommodate this change. (Aradan)
		[*]The enchanting tooltip will now provide the price after markup. This markup can be changed in the Enchantrix Barker window. (Aradan)
		[*]The code that handled the conversion of localized configuration settings has been removed. Users upgrading from older versions of Enchantrix may find their settings reset to default values. (Aradan)
		[*]Added per character settings. Currently this affects the “/enchantrix embed”, “/enchantrix print-in” and “/enchantrix counts” commands. All other options are still saved per account. (Aradan)
		[*]The built-in prices of disenchant results has been updated. (Aradan)
		[*]The disenchant database now uses ItemID’s instead of signatures. This reduces size and increases processing speed. (Aradan)
	[/list]
	[*]New Features:
	[list]
		[*]Enchantrix Barker. This feature found inside the Enchanting window, allows you to easily create messages to be sent over the trade channels to advertize your available enchants. Currently you need to have the mats for the reagents you want to sell in your inventory. You also need to be in a zone that has a trade channel. NOTE: Due to time constraints this feature has not been localized and is ONLY available in the en-US and en-GB locales (mwtb and Aradan)
		[*]A new command “/auctioneer terse (on|off|toggle)” has been added. Terse mode reduces the tooltip information to a single line with the item’s disenchant worth. This mode can be temporarily overridden by holding down the control key before clicking or hovering over an item. This setting is saved per character. (Aradan)
	[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]Informant:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Changes in the interface:
	[list]
		[*]Informant will now print exact buy/sell values, even for items that are worth more than one gold piece. (Luke1410)
	[/list]
	[*]Bug Fixes:
	[list]
		[*]Stack sizes for new items have been corrected. This was done by prioritizing data from GetItemInfo() over data from our internal database. (MentalPower)
	[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]EnhTooltip:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Changes in the interface:
	[list]
		[*]The old TT_Foo functions have been deleted. Please change to using the EnhTooltip functions table. (MentalPower)
		[*]The Enhanced Tooltip now supports Asian Characters. (MentalPower)
	[/list]
	[*]New Features:
	[list]
		[*]EnhTooltip.AddLine(lineText [, moneyAmmount, embed, bExact]) now takes an optional fourth Boolean parameter called bExact that when used in conjunction with the moneyAmount parameter causes the displayed money figures to be either exact or rounded. (Luke1410) 
		[*]Added function EnhTooltip.GetglobalIterator() to iterate over numbered globals, e.g. "EnhancedTooltipText<x>". (Aradan)
		[*]Hooked into GameTooltip:SetText(). This hook just clears our tooltip since we can’t do anything interesting with plain text anyways. (Aradan)
		[*]Added support for inbox items. NOTE: Due to the fact that we can’t get the item link directly, this will not work for items that have a suffix (of the Owl) or for those that share names (Voodoo Dolls). (MentalPower)
	[/list]
	[*]Bug Fixes:
	[list]
		[*]The hooking into GameTooltip:SetText() fixes some issues with non-item tooltips (empty inventory slots, backpack etc). (Aradan)
	[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]Installer:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Changes in the interface:
	[list]
		[*]Support has been added for Greek and Dutch languages. (MentalPower)
		[*]Support has been added for the BeanCounter AddOn. (MentalPower)
	[/list]
[/list]

[b][size=3]All AddOns:[/size][/b]
[list]
	[*]Changes in the interface:
	[list]
		[*]All AddOns now use the dynamic strings feature in Khaos to dynamically change their configuration strings without reloading the page. (MentalPower)
	[/list]
	[*]Numerous other bug fixes and enhancements that you probably won’t even notice.
